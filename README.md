Features

Supports both 301 and 501 game modes
Supports 1 to 100 players
Tracks each player's score across multiple rounds
Validates all inputs (no invalid scores or out-of-range values accepted)
Detects when a player busts (goes below 0) and keeps their score the same
Announces the winner when a player reaches exactly 0 points

How to Use

When prompted, type 301 or 501 to select the game mode
Enter the number of players (between 1 and 100)
Each round, every player enters the score of their 3 darts one by one

Each dart must be a number between 0 and 60


The program will subtract the total from the player's remaining points
If a player's score would go below 0, their points stay the same (bust)
The first player to reach exactly 0 points wins!
